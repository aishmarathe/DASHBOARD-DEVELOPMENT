# DASHBOARD-DEVELOPMENT
Smart Traffic & Pollution Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
Overview
This project presents a Smart Traffic & Pollution Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI, based on real-world data from OpenAQ (Open Air Quality Platform). The dashboard helps visualize and analyze the distribution of various pollutants across cities, with a special focus on PM2.5 levels.

Objective
The main goal of this dashboard is to:

Identify areas with high air pollution levels

Analyze the PM2.5 pollutant trends

Help users understand the impact of pollution on traffic-heavy areas

Data Source
OpenAQ API Dataset
The dataset includes real-time and historical air quality data collected from different cities.

Main pollutant attributes:

PM2.5

PM10

CO

NO2

SO2

O3

Key Features of the Dashboard
City-wise pollution concentration visualization

Filterable views for:

Country

City

Pollutant type

Date range

Heatmap and bar charts showing:

Top polluted cities

Highest PM2.5 concentrations

Temporal analysis (by hour/day/month)

Focused insights on PM2.5, which is considered one of the most dangerous air pollutants due to its ability to enter the lungs and bloodstream

Tools Used
Power BI Desktop

Power Query Editor

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

OpenAQ dataset (.csv or connected API)

Insights Gained
Identified cities with consistently high PM2.5 levels

Observed daily and monthly variations in pollution

Recognized pollution spikes in traffic-dense regions

How to Use
Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop

Use filters to select:

A specific city or region

Pollutant (focus on PM2.5 for detailed insights)

Time period

View visualizations like:

PM2.5 trend lines

City-wise pollution rankings

Comparative pollutant levels

Future Enhancements
Add traffic volume data to correlate with pollution levels

Implement real-time monitoring with OpenAQ API connection

Predict pollution spikes using ML models
