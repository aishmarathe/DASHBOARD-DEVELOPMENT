# Smart Traffic & PM2.5 Pollution Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview

This project presents a Power BI dashboard that visualizes air pollution data collected from the OpenAQ dataset. The primary focus is on analyzing PM2.5 pollutant levels across different cities. The dashboard is designed to help users identify high-pollution areas and understand the spread and intensity of air pollutants, especially in traffic-heavy zones.

## Objective

- Analyze real-time and historical pollution data
- Identify regions with high levels of PM2.5 pollutants
- Track pollution trends across cities and time periods
- Provide an interactive and visual representation to assist in traffic and environmental planning

## Data Source

- **Dataset**: OpenAQ (Open Air Quality Platform)
- **Attributes used**:
  - Location (City, Country)
  - Date and Time of measurement
  - Pollutant types: PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, O3
  - Pollution value and unit

## Key Features of the Dashboard

- Interactive filters for pollutant type, city, and date range
- Focused analysis on PM2.5 pollution trends
- City-wise comparison of pollution levels
- Time-series analysis showing changes in pollution over time
- Identification of the most polluted cities and regions

## Tools Used

- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated fields
- OpenAQ dataset (CSV format)

## Insights and Observations

- PM2.5 levels were consistently higher in certain urban and industrial areas
- Specific times of the day and year showed peak pollution levels
- Cities with high traffic density often had higher PM2.5 concentrations
- PM2.5 is a critical pollutant due to its ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. Open the `.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop
2. Use the slicers and filters to explore:
   - Specific cities or countries
   - Individual pollutants, especially PM2.5
   - Time ranges to see historical trends
3. Analyze visualizations such as:
   - Line charts for pollution over time
   - Bar charts showing most affected cities
   - Heatmaps for regional pollution intensity

## Future Improvements

- Integrate live data from the OpenAQ API
- Combine with traffic density datasets for better correlation analysis
- Add forecasting using time-series modeling
- Deploy as a web-based interactive dashboard
